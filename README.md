# chartDirect

This is a fork of the [AndroidCharts](https://github.com/HackPlan/AndroidCharts) library. It was created due to necessity for the [usageDirect](https://codeberg.org/fynngodau/usageDirect/) project.

It contains:

* a bar chart with condensed variant
* a clock pie chart
* an ordinary pie chart (unmaintained)
* a line chart (unmaintained)

### Features

The following may not apply to the unmaintained chart types.

* lightweight
* support for dark background
* `BarView` and `CondensedBarView` backed by `RecyclerView` for highest performance
* display different colors in charts
* accent color as default color

## Including in Your Project

Please use JitPack for downloading compiled AAR bundles. Sorry. [See how.](https://jitpack.io/#org.codeberg.fynngodau/chartDirect)

## Usage

### Bar chart

![Bar Chart](https://codeberg.org/fynngodau/chartDirect/raw/branch/main/pic/bar.png)


Include the `BarView` in your layout like this:

```xml
<im.dacer.androidcharts.bar.BarView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="300dp"
    android:id="@+id/bar_view" />
```

Set it up using Java:

```java
BarView barView = findViewById(R.id.bar_view);

// Construct Value object for each bar
Value[] values = new Value[]{

    // Single-colored bar
    new Value(50, "50"),

    // Multi-colored bar
    new MultiValue(
        new int[]{20, 40}, new Integer[]{Color.RED, Color.BLUE}
    )
};
barView.setData(values, 100);

// Optionally add vertical lines for scale
barView.setHorizontalLines(new Line[]{new Line(25, "25%")});

// Optionally enable zero line
barView.setZeroLineEnabled(true);

// Optionally scroll along dashed scale lines
// (need to pass windowBackground color for performance reasons)
barView.setScrollHorizontalLines(true, windowBackground)
```

A condensed variant with no margin between bars is also available â€“ simply use `CondensedBarView` instead of `BarView`.

### Clock Pie Chart

![Clock Pie Chart](https://codeberg.org/fynngodau/chartDirect/raw/branch/main/pic/pie.png)

```xml
<im.dacer.androidcharts.clockpie.ClockPieView
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:id="@+id/clock_pie_view" />
```

```java
ClockPieView pieView = findViewById(R.id.clock_pie_view);
ClockPieSegment[] pieSegments = new ClockPieSegment[]{
    new ClockPieSegemnt(14, 30, 17, 45); // from 14:30 until 17:45
}
pieView.setData(pieSegments);
```

You may also set a segment that is displayed as a background segment.

### Deprecated classes

For usage instructions on the deprecated classes, please refer to [the AndroidCharts README](https://github.com/HackPlan/AndroidCharts#line-chart).

## Comparison to original AndroidCharts library

| View | code quality improvement status | new features | other improvements | original example screenshot
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `LineView` | unchanged | no new features | none | ![Line Chart](https://raw.github.com/dacer/AndroidCharts/master/pic/line.png)
| `BarView` | **significantly improved** | background lines for scale (including labels), support for bold / italic labels, zero line (optional), condensed variant (`CondensedBarView`), multiple colors in one bar (`MultiValue`), backed by `RecyclerView` | fix missing margins, color set to accent color, support for dark background | ![Bar Chart](https://raw.github.com/dacer/AndroidCharts/master/pic/bar.png)
| `ClockPieView` | **improved** | gray out background partially (e.g. to display time as not passed yet), colored segments | support for drawing in views with larger width than height, support for drawing when view is set to `match_parent`, color set to accent color, remove animation as it was too slow, support for dark background | ![Clock Pie Chart](https://raw.github.com/dacer/AndroidCharts/master/pic/pie.png)
| `PieView` | unchanged | no new features | none | ![Pie Chart](https://raw.github.com/dacer/AndroidCharts/master/pic/pie2.png)
